% Input:
% z = complex number

% Output:
% color = the color associated with the root found by Newton’s Method
% according to the following key:
% color = ’y’, if Newton’s Method found z_1
% ’r’, if Newton’s Method found z_2
% ’b’, if Newton’s Method found z_3
% ’g’, if Newton’s Method found z_4
% ’k’, if Newton’s Method was unsuccessful
% after 20 iterations.
% More precisely, "unsuccessful" means that Matlab cannot reduce
% (z^2-1)(z^2+0.16) to less than 0.0001 (in absolute value) in at most
% 20 Newton iterations.
